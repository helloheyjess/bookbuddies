# Bookbuddies
_Bookbuddies rails app_

## To Do
* Map out potential routes (controller#action)
* Determine model columns (data types, etc.)
* Determine which content will be repeated, and can be made as partials
* Sketch up rough wire-frames for each page with content placement
* Purchase domain (bookbuddi.es)

### Design
* Leverage material design principals
* Use Basecamp as inspiration
* Use google books API, or Goodreads
* Google books can provide images, if desired.

### Userflow

* If not first time user or just filled out new profile, go to screen with option to create a group (with notification if you haven't created a group yet), groups the user belongs to (your groups).  There will also be a sidebar with your profile information and a button to edit.
* User can click on a group and go to a group page
* Book details (book cover, title, author, description), avatars of group members, meeting details (dates/days of the week, times, place), option to make private, maybe google maps, forum to add comments and chat (max number of messages and option to load more, edit/delete your own comments), add to Goodreads shelf link, links to buy the book, links to other books by the same author

### Models (attributes/data_types)
_Holding off on building models until we get these figured out more. Some models will need what Trudy called 'associations', whereby models are linked to other models. For example: the *comment* model will be linked to the *groups* model, so that comments can exist within groups, and be linked bath to the author_
